# pttModelStudies

In the reposity I wish to compare the effect of several parameters on linear and exponential PTT models.

The parameters varied are:

* Type of model (linear or exponential)
* Zero-shear viscosity (either 333 or 3333)
* Relaxation time lambda (either 1 or 100)
* "Elasticity" parameter epsilon (either 0.25 or 0.01)
* "Affinity" parameter zeta (TBD)

I intend to create combined curves featuring

* Shear viscosity as a function of shear rate
* Elongational viscosity as a function of elongation rate
* Normal
* First normal stress difference as a function of shear rate
* Shear stress during start-up
* Elongational stress during start-up
* Theoretical (!) molecular weight distribution
